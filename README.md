# A-Network-Analysis-of-Game-of-Thrones


This project was carried out practically on DataCamp. In this research, we examine the character co-occurrence network and how it changed throughout the five volumes of the wildly successful A Song of Ice and Fire novel series by R.R. Martin. Using several centrality measures, we'll examine how the characters' significance shifts over the books. This project uses a dataset parsed by Andrew J. Beveridge and Jie Shan which is available here- https://github.com/mathbeveridge/asoiaf.
